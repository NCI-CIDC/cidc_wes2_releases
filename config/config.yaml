## sentieon path
## The realigner and recalibration tools in old wes are from `sentieon driver`
## and the documentation isn't immediately clear about the identity
## of the underlying algorithms. Algos in re-alignment vary in accuracy, so
## for now this step will be written using sentieon, but might be re-written
## using something like DeepVariant.
