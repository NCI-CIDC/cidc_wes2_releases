##type: either "TN" or "TO" for "tumor normal", "tumor only"
##
##run: identical to tumor cimac_id
##
##normal: cimac_id for the corresponding normal_sample.
##        if sample is tumor-only, this field is left blank.
##        Pipeline will confirm with the "type" field that
##        this is appropriately a tumor only sample. for
##        TO samples, this field is left blank.
